# System Monitor 

## Objective

A log monitoring utility that parses log files, generates statistical summaries, and is fully containerized using Docker.

---

## Project Description

`system-monitor` is a Bash-based log analysis tool that accepts a log file as input, validates it, and produces a structured summary report (`summary.txt`) containing total line counts, ERROR and WARNING frequencies, and the top 3 most frequently occurring meaningful words. The utility is containerized using Docker with volume mounting support for flexible log file input and output.

## Directory Structure

```

├── monitor.sh
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── summary.txt
└── logs/
    └── sample.log
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Linux VM (Ubuntu 22.04 or similar)
- Git installed and configured
- Docker installed and running

---

## Manual Execution

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanket3212/system-monitor.git
cd system-monitor
```

### Step 2 — Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh
```

### Step 3 — Run the script

```bash
/monitor.sh logs/sample.log
```

### Step 4 — View the generated summary

```bash
cat summary.txt
```

---

## Docker Build and Run Instructions

### Step 1 — Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t system-monitor .
```

### Step 2 — Run the container with volume mounts

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  system-monitor logs/sample.log
```

### Step 3 — View the output on host machine

```bash
cat summary.txt
```

### Volume Explanation

| Volume Mount | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs` | Mounts host log folder into the container for input |
| `-v $(pwd):/app` | Mounts project folder so `summary.txt` is saved back to the host |

---

## Summary Output Explanation

After execution, `summary.txt` is generated in the project root with the following structure:

```
========================================
           LOG SUMMARY REPORT
========================================
Input File        : logs/sample.log
Generated On      : YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Generated By      : monitor.sh
----------------------------------------
BASIC STATISTICS
----------------------------------------
Total Lines       : XX
ERROR Count       : XX
WARNING Count     : XX
----------------------------------------
TOP 3 FREQUENT WORDS
----------------------------------------
1. word1 - XX
2. word2 - XX
3. word3 - XX
----------------------------------------
END OF REPORT
----------------------------------------
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Input File | Path to the log file passed as argument |
| Generated On | Timestamp of report generation |
| Generated By | Name of the script that produced the report |
| Total Lines | Total number of lines in the log file |
| ERROR Count | Case-insensitive count of lines containing "error" |
| WARNING Count | Case-insensitive count of lines containing "warning" |
| Top 3 Frequent Words | Most common meaningful words |

git push origin dev
```

### Creating a Pull Request (PR)
```bash
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on Compare & Pull Request.
Add a title and description.
Create the PR from dev → main.
```

### Merging to Main Branch
```bash
Review the Pull Request.
Click Merge Pull Request.
Confirm the merge.
